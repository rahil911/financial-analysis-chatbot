# Database Files

Due to GitHub's file size limits, the database file (`financial.db`) is not included in this repository.

## Option 1: Generate Sample Data

You can generate sample data by running:

```bash
python generate_sample_data.py
```

This will create a `financial.db` file in this directory with realistic sample data for testing the chatbot.

## Option 2: Download the Database

If your friend shared the original database file with you separately, simply place it in this directory (`poc1/data/financial.db`).

## Option 3: Create Your Own Database

If you want to use your own data, you can create a database following the schema described in `DATABASE_SETUP.md` in the root of this repository.
